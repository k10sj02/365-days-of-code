## 365 Days of Code Challenges & Solutions

Welcome to the Year-Round Code Challenges Solutions repository! This repository contains my solutions to various programming challenges, inspired by the Advent of Code puzzles. These challenges are great for honing your coding skills and exploring diverse problem-solving techniques throughout the year.

### What are Code Challenges?

These challenges are designed to test and improve your coding skills through fun and engaging puzzles. They cover a wide range of topics and difficulty levels, providing an excellent opportunity to practice and learn new concepts.

### Repository Structure

The repository is organized by year and challenge, with each folder containing the solutions for the respective challenge.

```

### Primary Python Concepts Covered

Throughout these challenges, you will encounter and work on a variety of Python concepts, including but not limited to:

1. **Variables and Data Types**
   - Understand and utilize different data types such as integers, strings, lists, tuples, and dictionaries.
   
2. **Conditions**
   - Implement conditional logic using `if`, `elif`, and `else` statements to control the flow of your programs.

3. **Loops**
   - Use `for` and `while` loops to iterate over data structures and perform repetitive tasks efficiently.
   
4. **Functions**
   - Define and call functions to encapsulate reusable code, making your solutions modular and organized.

5. **File I/O**
   - Read from and write to files to handle input and output data for the challenges.
   
6. **List Comprehensions**
   - Use list comprehensions for concise and readable list manipulations.
   
7. **Error Handling**
   - Implement error handling using `try`, `except`, and `finally` blocks to make your code robust and error-resistant.
   
8. **Recursion**
   - Solve problems using recursive functions, a technique where a function calls itself to break down complex problems.
   
9. **Libraries and Modules**
   - Import and utilize Python libraries and modules to leverage existing tools and functionalities.
   
10. **Algorithms and Data Structures**
    - Apply common algorithms and data structures to efficiently solve the challenges, such as searching, sorting, and graph traversal algorithms.
